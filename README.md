Hi, I’m Imre Draskovits. I am a British-Hungarian entrepreneur and computer scientist.
Originally from Budapest, I now live in the United Kingdom, where I design and build apps that support research and innovation in academia, with a focus on tools that feel intuitive and effortless to use.

In my spare time, I collaborate with local entrepreneurs in fitness and marketing, helping them with software for wearable integrations and survey tools that save their customers time.
I’m passionate about crafting thoughtful, human-centred technology that makes everyday work smoother, smarter, and more manageable.
