I design, build, and deploy software that breaks convention and rejects the polished-but-pointless norms of modern tech.

Originally from Budapest, now based in the United Kingdom, I’ve spent the last few years building systems for researchers ranging from archaeologists to liver and kidney transplant surgeons. My work combines disciplined engineering with a deep frustration for bad design, bloated platforms, and lifeless apps.  

## In the News
I’ve contributed software to several academic research projects, some of which have been featured in the media:
