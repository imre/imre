I design, build, and deploy software that breaks convention and rejects the polished-but-pointless norms of modern tech.

Originally from Budapest, now based in the United Kingdom, I’ve spent the last few years building systems for researchers ranging from archaeologists to liver and kidney transplant surgeons. My work combines disciplined engineering with a deep frustration for bad design, bloated platforms, and lifeless apps.  

I build software with precise purpose, apps that respect people’s time, feels sharp and honest. I have no interest in glossy distractions or behaviour-manipulating patterns. My focus is on crafting digital experiences that are clear in intent, direct in function, and grounded in real human need.

## In the News
I’ve contributed software to several academic research projects, some of which have been featured in the media:

## Software

I enjoy working with clever software that's stupidly simple to set up and use.
