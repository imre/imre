I'm a software engineer living in the UK, and I spend most of my time building mobile apps and data collection tools. What really matters to me is designing software that feels good to use: simple, thoughtful, and made with care.  

Growing up, I often turned to computers as a place where things made sense, a space full of clever tools, creativity, and possibility. That experience inspired me to build tools that feel intuitive and inspiring for others, ones that spark ideas, feel like they 'get you,' and maybe even bring a bit of calm or joy.
