I am a British-Hungarian entrepreneur and computer scientist. Originally from Budapest, Iâ€™m now based in the United Kingdom, where in my day job I design and build intuitive apps that support research, innovation, and individual creators.

In my spare time I support business owners, especially in the fitness industry to overcome their software challenges. My mission is to create seamless companion apps and software ecosystems for wearable devices, with a focus on supporting personal trainers and their clients.
